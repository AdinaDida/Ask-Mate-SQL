2,1581433047,19,0,She's a lot more powerful during the Early game and parts of the Mid game. not as much really for late to be honest. except her one ultimate which could change something during a teamfight once per use.,mfanswer2.jpg
3,1581445410,10,0,Only her ulti is good for late game teamfights. just stand back and let it rain. also 1 v 1 late game but that would never be the case.,mfanswer3.jpg
4,1581445414,11,1,This site seems to show a popularity list. although it just looks like a pick rate list.,played.jpg
5,1581445629,7,2,Jax. most gold players are worse than silver. any scaling champion will get you good results most of times. don't waste time early ganking unless you snowball for yourself cause I guarantee no one will use effective the lead you give them.,jax.jpg

7,1581510656,6,2,I'd suggest making a diverse champion pool. Tank or Mage or Assassin.,pool.jpg
8,1581510662,40,3,Use ancient coin when you need the mana or are up against a poke-heavy lane. I always take ancient coin when I don't think I'll get enough gold from relic shield or when I didn't take manaflow band.,blitz1.jpg
9,1581511307,32,3,I prefer Coin as it helps you recover the mana you wasted on hooks.,blitz3.jpg
10,1581511313,9,3,Relic is by far the most common pickup. Relic gives max HP and HP regen while coin only gives mana regen.,blitz2.jpg

13,1581599777,5,5,To be fair. it really depends on your midlane matchup. Most matchups really destroy  Pyke and if you manage to get behind just by a little bit. you're screwed He used to be insanely good and I used to love to play him while his Q-tap could hit multiple targets and did more damage.,pyke1.jpg
14,1581449636,6,5,It depends how you play. I have seen playing Yasuo support and was one of the best support. so you can play what ever you want. just practice.,pyke2.jpg
